    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."

      "Okay, so I'm trying to understand what underpins language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on neural networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers. I remember that LLMs are big AI systems that can generate or perform tasks like text generation, but I'm not entirely sure how they work behind the scenes. Let me start by thinking about each concept one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's tackle neural networks since it's a broad area. I know that most AI models, including LLMs, rely heavily on neural networks. They're often referred to as deep learning models because they have multiple layers. So, what exactly is a neural network? It sounds like a series of layers that process information through interconnected nodes or neurons. Each layer processes data and then sends the processed information (like an activation vector) to the next layer. This way, each layer can extract new features from the data it receives.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do these neural networks work together at different levels in LLMs? I think LLMs have a structured network with layers that handle specific tasks or parts of the generation process. Maybe the lower layers are focused on character-level processing (like individual words), and higher layers deal with longer-term dependencies, which could involve phrases or sentences as inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at attention mechanisms. I remember hearing about this in the context of how LLMs focus more on what's important when making a prediction. Instead of considering every word in the text, the model can attend only to specific words that are relevant for generating certain outputs, like names or directions. This selective focus leads to shorter computation times and better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does this attention work with the transformer architecture? Transformers have been revolutionary in AI, especially NLP tasks because they are based on different computational models compared to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The key difference is that in transformers, each layer processes data in both directions. That means information propagates in two opposite ways through the layers, allowing for parallel processing and addressing some limitations of RNNs with sequential data.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, putting this together, LLMs use a neural network structure composed of multiple layers operating at different levels. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when its output is generated. Transformers enhance this by handling data in both directions through their block structures and utilizing attention within these blocks. Together, each component contributes to the model's ability to process complex tasks through layers that extract features from inputs and generate outputs with improved effectiveness.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "LLMs, such as language models, are built on several key components: neural networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neural Networks (Deep Learning Models):**\n",
      "   - Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transmit information through layers of data. Each layer extracts new features from the input by propagating an activation vector to the next layer.\n",
      "   - In LLMs, these networks are structured across multiple levels for character-level processing and handling longer-term dependencies. Lower layers focus on individual words, while higher layers consider larger chunks like sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Attention Mechanisms:**\n",
      "   - Attention helps the model prioritize relevant information in input data when generating outputs, reducing reliance on all words without compromising performance.\n",
      "   - Unlike RNNs, which process data sequentially, attention allows the model focused on specific parts (e.g., names or directions), enhancing generation efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transformers:**\n",
      "   - Built using block structures that process data in both directions simultaneously, transformers address memory issues seen with RNNs and better parallelize information for faster execution.\n",
      "   - Each transformer layer includes processing within blocks for character-level and longer-term contexts (phrases/phrases), focusing on relevant parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:** \n",
      "LLMs leverage neural networks across levels,attention mechanisms for selective focus, and transformers for efficient sequential and parallel processing. Together, these components enable effective handling of complex data through layers that enhance feature extraction and output generation.\n"

Perhaps they're testing my ability to handle different types of questions beyond basic arithmetic.\n",
